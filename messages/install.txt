Welcome to SublimeGit
=====================

SublimeGit is a full-featured, open-source plugin for integrating
git into Sublime Text 2 and 3. To read more about it go to
https://github.com/Sublimegit/Sublimegit/.


Quickstart
----------
Make sure to restart Sublime Text after installing SublimeGit.

Run the command "Git: Status" to open the status view. This
is where you'll spend most of the time when interacting with
git through SublimeGit. From here you can stage/unstage files,
manage stashes, view diffs, and initiate a commit.

Other commands are available in the command palette (cmd+shift+p
on OS X, ctrl+shift+p on Windows/Linux). They are all prefixed
with "Git:" and most of them do exactly what it says on the label.
